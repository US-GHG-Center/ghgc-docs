    "text": "About the Data\n\nMiCASA Land Carbon Flux\nThis dataset presents a variety of carbon flux parameters derived from the Más Informada Carnegie-Ames-Stanford-Approach (MiCASA) model. The model’s input data includes air temperature, precipitation, incident solar radiation, a soil classification map, and several satellite derived products. All model calculations are driven by analyzed meteorological data from NASA’s Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Application, Version 2 (MERRA-2). The resulting product provides global, daily data at 0.1 degree resolution from January 2001 through December 2023. It includes carbon flux variables expressed in units of kilograms of carbon per square meter per day (kg Carbon/m²/day) from net primary production (NPP), heterotrophic respiration (Rh), wildfire emissions (FIRE), fuel wood burning emissions (FUEL), net ecosystem exchange (NEE), and net biosphere exchange (NBE). The latter two are derived from the first four (see Scientific Details below). MiCASA is an extensive revision of the CASA – Global Fire Emissions Database, version 3 (CASA-GFED3) product. CASA-GFED3 and earlier versions of MERRA-driven CASA-GFED carbon fluxes have been used in several atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO₂) transport studies, serve as a community standard for priors of flux inversion systems, and through the support of NASA’s Carbon Monitoring System (CMS), help characterize, quantify, understand and predict the evolution of global carbon sources and sinks.\nFor more information regarding this dataset, please visit the U.S. Greenhouse Gas Center.",

All model calculations are driven by analyzed meteorological data from NASA's Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Application, Version 2 (MERRA-2). The resulting product provides global, monthly mean data at 0.1 degree resolution starting from January 2001. The carbon flux variables are expressed in units of kilograms of carbon per square meter per day. Monthly mean layers are computed by taking the mean carbon flux of all days in the month. MiCASA is an extensive revision of the CASA – Global Fire Emissions Database, version 3 (CASA-GFED3) product. CASA-GFED3 and earlier versions of MERRA-driven CASA-GFED carbon fluxes have been used in several atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO₂) transport studies, serve as a community standard for priors of flux inversion systems, and through the support of NASA's Carbon Monitoring System (CMS), help characterize, quantify, understand and predict the evolution of global carbon sources and sinks.\"\n        \n

The dataset contains emissions over the contiguous United States covering major anthropogenic sectors, including energy, industrial fuel combustion and processes, commercial and residential combustion, oil and gas production, on-road and off-road transportation, etc. (see Table 1 in the Scientific Details section below for a full sector list). Fossil fuel CO2 (ffCO2) emissions are developed along with those of air pollutants including CO, NOx, SOx, and PM2.5 with consistency in spatial and temporal distributions. Emissions by sectors are grouped into point and area sources, reported as column totals in units of metric tons per km2 per month. Spatial-temporal surrogates are developed to distribute CO2 emissions to grid cells to keep consistency between greenhouse gases and air quality species. The current version of GRA2PES is for 2021. Long-term emissions and more greenhouse gas species (e.g., methane) are under development and will be added in the future.\nFor more information regarding this dataset, please visit the GRA2PES Greenhouse Gas and Air Quality Species, Version 1 data overview page.",

    "text": "About the Data\nThis tutorial guides a user to further explore data from the Carbon Observatory (OCO-2) modeling intercomparison project (MIP). It is designed for those with more understanding of the science and is therefore labeled as intermediate level.\nThe code is used to estimate the annual net terrestrial carbon stock loss (ΔCloss) and net carbon exchange (NCE) for a given country using the “top-down” NCE outputs from the Carbon Observatory (OCO-2) modeling intercomparison project (MIP). Several standardized experiments are studied in this notebook based on the OCO-2 MIP dataset including flux estimates from in situ CO₂ measurements (IS), flux estimates from OCO-2 land CO₂ data (LNLG), combined in situ and OCO-2 land CO₂ data (LNLGIS), and combined in situ and OCO-2 land and ocean CO₂ data (LNLGOGIS). Estimates and uncertainties associated with fossil fuels, riverine fluxes, and wood and crop fluxes are also graphed along with the ΔCloss and NCE variables.\nFor more information about this data collection, please visit the OCO-2 MIP Top-Down CO2 Budgets data overview page.\nFor more information regarding this dataset, please visit the U.S. Greenhouse Gas Center.",

    "text": "About the Data\nMethane (CH₄) emissions from vegetated wetlands are estimated to be the largest natural source of methane in the global CH₄ budget, contributing to roughly one third of the total of natural and anthropogenic emissions. Wetland CH₄ is produced by microbes breaking down organic matter in the oxygen deprived environment of inundated soils. Due to limited data availability, the details of the role of wetland CH₄ emissions have thus far been underrepresented. Using the Earth Observation SIMulator version (LPJ-EOSIM) of the Lund-Potsdam-Jena Dynamic Global Vegetation Model (LPJ-DGVM) global CH₄ emissions from wetlands are estimated at 0.5° x 0.5 degree spatial resolution. By simulating wetland extent and using characteristics of inundated areas, such as wetland soil moisture, temperature, and carbon content, the model provides estimates of CH₄ quantities emitted into the atmosphere. This dataset shows concentrated methane sources from tropical and high latitude ecosystems. The LPJ-EOSIM Wetland Methane Emissions dataset consists of global daily model estimates of terrestrial wetland methane emissions from 1990 to the present, with data added bimonthly. The monthly data has been curated by aggregating the daily files. The estimates are regularly used in conjunction with NASA’s Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS) model to simulate the impact of wetlands and other methane sources on atmospheric methane concentrations, to compare against satellite and airborne data, and to improve understanding and prediction of wetland emissions.\nFor more information regarding this dataset, please visit the Wetland Methane Emissions, LPJ-EOSIM Model data overview page.",

The model’s input data includes air temperature, precipitation, incident solar radiation, a soil classification map, and a number of satellite derived products. All model calculations are driven by analyzed meteorological data from NASA’s Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Application, Version 2 (MERRA-2). The resulting product provides monthly, global data at 0.5 degree resolution from January 2003 through December 2017. It includes the following carbon flux variables expressed in units of kilograms of carbon per square meter per month (kg Carbon m²/mon) from the following sources: net primary production (NPP), net ecosystem exchange (NEE), heterotrophic respiration (Rh), wildfire emissions (FIRE), and fuel wood burning emissions (FUEL). This product and earlier versions of MERRA-driven CASA-GFED carbon fluxes have been used in a number of atmospheric CO₂ transport studies, and through the support of NASA’s Carbon Monitoring System (CMS), it helps characterize, quantify, understand and predict the evolution of global carbon sources and sinks."

    "section": "About the Data",
    "text": "About the Data\n\nOCO-2 GEOS Column CO2 Concentrations\nIn July 2014, NASA successfully launched the first dedicated Earth remote sensing satellite to study atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO₂) from space. The Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) is an exploratory science mission designed to collect space-based global measurements of atmospheric CO₂ with the precision, resolution, and coverage needed to characterize sources and sinks (fluxes) on regional scales (≥1000 km). This dataset provides global gridded, daily column-averaged carbon dioxide (XCO₂) concentrations from January 1, 2015 - February 28, 2022. The data are derived from OCO-2 observations that were input to the Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS) Constituent Data Assimilation System (CoDAS), a modeling and data assimilation system maintained by NASA’s Global Modeling and Assimilation Office (GMAO). Concentrations are measured in moles of carbon dioxide per mole of dry air (mol CO₂/mol dry) at a spatial resolution of 0.5° x 0.625°. Data assimilation synthesizes simulations and observations, adjusting modeled atmospheric constituents like CO₂ to reflect observed values. With the support of NASA’s Carbon Monitoring System (CMS) Program and the OCO Science Team, this dataset was produced as part of the OCO-2 mission which provides the highest quality space-based XCO₂ retrievals to date.\nFor more information regarding this dataset, please visit the OCO-2 GEOS Column CO₂ Concentrations data overview page.",

NIST’s objective is to develop measurement tools supporting independent means to increase the accuracy of greenhouse gas emissions data at urban and regional geospatial scales. NIST has established three test beds in U.S. cities to develop and evaluate the performance of advanced measurement capabilities for emissions independent of their origin. Located in Indianapolis, Indiana, the Los Angeles air basin of California, and the U.S. Northeast corridor (beginning with the Baltimore/Washington D.C. region), the test beds have been selected for their varying meteorology, terrain and emissions characteristics. These test beds will serve as a means to independently diagnose the accuracy of emissions data obtained directly from emission or uptake sources.\nFor more information regarding this dataset, please visit the Carbon Dioxide and Methane Concentrations from the Northeast Corridor (NEC) Urban Test Bed data overview page.",

    "text": "About the Data\n\nEMIT Methane Point Source Plume Complexes\nThe Earth Surface Mineral Dust Source Investigation (EMIT) instrument builds upon NASA’s long history of developing advanced imaging spectrometers for new science and applications. EMIT launched to the International Space Station (ISS) on July 14, 2022. The data shows high-confidence research grade methane plumes from point source emitters - updated as they are identified - in keeping with Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) Open Science and Open Data policy.\nLarge methane emissions, typically referred to as point source emissions, represent a significant proportion of total methane emissions from the production, transport, and processing of oil and natural gas, landfills, and other sources. By measuring the spectral fingerprint of methane, EMIT can map areas of high methane concentration over background levels in the atmosphere, identifying plume complexes, and estimating the methane enhancements.\nFor more information regarding this dataset, please visit the EMIT Methane Point Source Plume Complexes data overview page.",

    "section": "About the Data",
    "text": "About the Data\n\nAir-Sea CO₂ Flux ECCO-Darwin Model\nThe ocean is a major sink for atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO₂), largely due to the presence of phytoplankton that use the CO₂ to grow. Studies have shown that global ocean CO₂ uptake has increased over recent decades, however, there is uncertainty in the various mechanisms that affect ocean CO₂ flux and storage and how the ocean carbon sink will respond to future climate change.\nBecause CO₂ fluxes can vary significantly across space and time, combined with deficiencies in ocean and atmosphere CO₂ observations, there is a need for models that can thoroughly represent these processes. Ocean biogeochemical models (OBMs) can resolve the physical and biogeochemical mechanisms contributing to spatial and temporal variations in air-sea CO₂ fluxes but previous OBMs do not integrate observations to improve model accuracy and have not been able to operate on the seasonal and multi-decadal timescales needed to adequately characterize these processes.\nThe ECCO-Darwin model is an OBM that assimilates Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean (ECCO) consortium ocean circulation estimates and biogeochemical processes from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Darwin Project. A pilot study using ECCO-Darwin was completed by Brix et al. (2015) however, an improved version of the model was developed by Carroll et al. (2020) in which issues present in the first model were addressed using data assimilation and adjustments were made to initial conditions and biogeochemical parameters. The updated ECCO-Darwin model was compared with interpolation-based products to estimate surface ocean partial pressure (pCO2) and air-sea CO₂ flux. This dataset contains the gridded global, monthly mean air-sea CO₂ fluxes from version 5 of the ECCO-Darwin model.\nThe data available in the US GHG Center hub are available at ~1/3° horizontal resolution at the equator (~18 km at high latitudes) from January 2020 through December 2022. For more information regarding this dataset, please visit the Air-Sea CO₂ Flux ECCO-Darwin Model data overview page.",

The NASA Carbon Monitoring System Flux (CMS-Flux) team has used remote sensing observations from Japan's Greenhouse gases Observing SATellite (GOSAT) to produce modeled total methane (CH₄) emissions and uncertainties on a 1 degree by 1 degree resolution grid for the year 2019. The GOSAT data is used in the model to inform total emission estimates, as well as wetland (the primary natural source of methane), and various human-related sources such as fossil fuel extraction, transport, agriculture, waste, and fires. A prior GHG emission estimate (and assocated uncertainty) is provided for each layer, which is the emissions estimate without GOSAT data. The posterior GHG emission layers are informed by GOSAT total column methane data. An advanced mathematical approach is used with a global chemistry transport model to quantify annual CH₄ emissions and uncertainties. These estimates are expressed in teragrams of CH₄ per year (Tg/yr).

    "text": "About the Data\nMethane (CH₄) emissions from vegetated wetlands are estimated to be the largest natural source of methane in the global CH₄ budget, contributing to roughly one third of the total of natural and anthropogenic emissions. Wetland CH₄ is produced by microbes breaking down organic matter in the oxygen deprived environment of inundated soils. Due to limited data availability, the details of the role of wetland CH₄ emissions have thus far been underrepresented. Using the Earth Observation SIMulator version (LPJ-EOSIM) of the Lund-Potsdam-Jena Dynamic Global Vegetation Model (LPJ-DGVM) global CH₄ emissions from wetlands are estimated at 0.5° x 0.5 degree spatial resolution. By simulating wetland extent and using characteristics of inundated areas, such as wetland soil moisture, temperature, and carbon content, the model provides estimates of CH₄ quantities emitted into the atmosphere. This dataset shows concentrated methane sources from tropical and high latitude ecosystems. The LPJ-EOSIM Wetland Methane Emissions dataset consists of global daily model estimates of terrestrial wetland methane emissions from 1990 to the present, with data added bimonthly. The estimates are regularly used in conjunction with NASA’s Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS) model to simulate the impact of wetlands and other methane sources on atmospheric methane concentrations, to compare against satellite and airborne data, and to improve understanding and prediction of wetland emissions.\nFor more information regarding this dataset, please visit the U.S. Greenhouse Gas Center."

NIST’s objective is to develop measurement tools supporting independent means to increase the accuracy of greenhouse gas emissions data at urban and regional geospatial scales. NIST has established three test beds in U.S. ciies to develop and evaluate the performance of advanced measurement capabilities for emissions independent of their origin. Located in Indianapolis, Indiana, the Los Angeles air basin of California, and the U.S. Northeast corridor (beginning with the Baltimore/Washington D.C. region), the test beds have been selected for their varying meteorology, terrain and emissions characteristics. These test beds will serve as a means to independently diagnose the accuracy of emissions data obtained directly from emission or uptake sources.\nFor more information regarding this dataset, please visit the Carbon Dioxide and Methane Concentrations from the Los Angeles Megacity Carbon Project data overview page.",

The data have been converted from their original NetCDF format to Cloud-Optimized GeoTIFF (COG) for use in the US GHG Center, thereby enabling user exploration of spatial anthropogenic methane emissions and their trends.\nThe gridded dataset currently includes 34 data layers. The first data layer includes annual 2012-2020 gridded methane emissions fluxes from all anthropogenic sources of methane in the U.S. GHGI (excluding Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) sources, which are not included in the gridded GHGI). The next six data layers include annual 2012-2020 gridded methane fluxes from sources within the aggregate Agriculture, Natural Gas, Petroleum, Waste, Industry, and ‘Other’ source categories. The remaining 27 data layers include annual 2012-2020 gridded methane emissions fluxes from individual emission sectors within each of the aggregate categories.\nFor more information regarding this dataset, please visit the U.S. Gridded Anthropogenic Methane Emissions Inventory data overview page.",

NIST’s objective is to develop measurement tools supporting independent means to increase the accuracy of greenhouse gas emissions data at urban and regional geospatial scales. NIST has established three test beds in U.S. cities to develop and evaluate the performance of advanced measurement capabilities for emissions independent of their origin. Located in Indianapolis, Indiana, the Los Angeles air basin of California, and the U.S. Northeast corridor (beginning with the Baltimore/Washington D.C. region), the test beds have been selected for their varying meteorology, terrain and emissions characteristics. These test beds will serve as a means to independently diagnose the accuracy of emissions data obtained directly from emission or uptake sources.\nFor more information regarding this dataset, please visit the Carbon Dioxide and Methane Concentrations from the Indianapolis Flux Experiment (INFLUX) data overview page.",

Different sources of methane contain different ratios of the two stable isotopologues, ¹²CH₄ and ¹³CH₄. This makes normally indistinguishable collocated sources of methane, say from agriculture and oil and gas exploration, distinguishable. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) collects whole air samples from its global cooperative network of flasks (https://gml.noaa.gov/ccgg/about.html), which are then analyzed for methane and other trace gasses. A subset of those flasks are also analyzed for ¹³C of methane in collaboration with the Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research at the University of Colorado Boulder. Scientists at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and NOAA used those measurements of methane and ¹³C of methane in conjunction with a model of atmospheric circulation to estimate emissions of methane separated by three source types, microbial, fossil and pyrogenic.\nFor more information regarding this dataset, please visit the CarbonTracker-CH₄ Isotopic Methane Inverse Fluxes data overview page.",

    "text": "About the Data\nThe Global Greenhouse Gas Reference Network (GGGRN) for the Carbon Cycle and Greenhouse Gases (CCGG) Group is part of NOAA’S Global Monitoring Laboratory (GML) in Boulder, CO. The Reference Network measures the atmospheric distribution and trends of the three main long-term drivers of climate change, carbon dioxide (CO₂), methane (CH₄), and nitrous oxide (N2O), as well as carbon monoxide (CO) and many other trace gases which help interpretation of the main GHGs. The Reference Network measurement program includes continuous in-situ measurements at 4 baseline observatories (global background sites) and 8 tall towers, as well as flask-air samples collected by volunteers at over 50 additional regional background sites and from small aircraft conducting regular vertical profiles. The air samples are returned to GML for analysis where measurements of about 55 trace gases are done. NOAA’s GGGRN maintains the World Meteorological Organization international calibration scales for CO₂, CH₄, CO, N2O, and SF6 in air. The measurements from the GGGRN serve as a comparison with measurements made by many other international laboratories, and with regional studies. They are widely used in modeling studies that infer space-time patterns of emissions and removals of greenhouse gases that are optimally consistent with the atmospheric observations, given wind patterns. These data serve as an early warning for climate “surprises”. The measurements are also helpful for the ongoing evaluation of remote sensing technologies.\nFor more information regarding this dataset, please visit the Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide Concentrations from NOAA GML data overview page.",

Shown is the estimated total annual ffCO₂ for the United States, as well as the estimated total annual ffCO₂ per sector. Data are in units of metric tons of carbon dioxide per 1 km x 1 km grid cell per year (tonne CO₂/km²/year). Note: for the Residential sector, this collection shows Scope 1 emissions which refer to greenhouse gases released directly on site, from sources like vehicles, boilers, and furnaces. The Vulcan Project is a multiagency (NASA, DOE, NOAA, NIST) funded effort under the North American Carbon Program (NACP) to quantify North American fossil fuel carbon dioxide (ffCO₂) emissions at space and time scales much finer than has been achieved in the past. The purpose is to aid in quantification of the North American carbon budget, to support inverse estimation of carbon sources and sinks, and to support the demands posed by higher resolution ffCO₂ observations (in situ and remotely sensed). The detail and scope of the Vulcan ffCO₂ inventory has also made it a valuable tool for policymakers, demographers, social scientists and the public at large.

Referred to as ffCO₂, the emissions from Vulcan are also categorized into 10 source sectors including; airports, cement production, commercial marine vessels, commercial, power plants, industrial, non-road, on-road, residential and railroads. Data are gridded annually on a 1-km grid for the years 2010 to 2021. These data are annual sums of hourly estimates. Shown is the estimated total annual ffCO₂ for the United States, as well as the estimated total annual ffCO₂ per sector. Data are in units of metric tons of carbon dioxide per 1 km x 1 km grid cell per year (tonne CO₂/km²/year). Note: for the Residential sector, this collection shows Scope 1 emissions which refer to greenhouse gases released directly on site, from sources like vehicles, boilers, and furnaces. The Vulcan Project is a multiagency (NASA, DOE, NOAA, NIST) funded effort under the North American Carbon Program (NACP) to quantify North American fossil fuel carbon dioxide (ffCO₂) emissions at space and time scales much finer than has been achieved in the past. The purpose is to aid in quantification of the North American carbon budget, to support inverse estimation of carbon sources and sinks, and to support the demands posed by higher resolution ffCO₂ observations (in situ and remotely sensed). The detail and scope of the Vulcan ffCO₂ inventory has also made it a valuable tool for policymakers, demographers, social scientists and the public at large.
