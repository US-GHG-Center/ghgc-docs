title: "U.S. Greenhouse Gas Center: Data Transformation Notebooks"
---

Welcome to the homepage for the [U.S. Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Center](https://earth.gov/ghgcenter) data transformation notebooks. Our curated collection of GHG datasets are optimized for seamless accessibility and analysis. The GHG Center uses Cloud Optimized Geotiffs (COGs) and other cloud-optimized data formats where applicable to offer a dynamic platform for exploring and analyzing data within the [GHG Center Data Catalog](https://earth.gov/ghgcenter/data-catalog).

If a dataset was processed from its original format for integration into the GHG Center portal, the code used for this transformation is cataloged below. Click on a dataset name to learn more about the process.
