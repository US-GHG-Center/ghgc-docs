title: "U.S. Greenhouse Gas Center: Data Transformation Notebooks"
---

Welcome to the [U.S. Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Center](https://earth.gov/ghgcenter) data transformation notebooks, where we harness the power of Cloud Optimized Geotiffs (COGs) to offer a dynamic, cloud-based platform for exploring and analyzing greenhouse gas datasets.
Dive into our curated collection of GHG datasets, all optimized for seamless accessibility and analysis. 

Discover the journey of each dataset from its original format to COGs through the below Jupyter notebooks. The transformation examples are grouped topically. The dataset product type (model output, satellite observation, etc.) is noted next to the notebook name. Click on a notebook to learn more about the dataset and to view the transformation code.

Join us in our mission to make data-driven environmental solutions.
Explore, analyze, and make a difference with the US GHG Center.

**Note**: Not all datasets have a transformation code
