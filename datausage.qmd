title: "U.S. Greenhouse Gas Center: Data Usage Notebooks"
---

Welcome to the homepage for the [U.S. Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Center](https://earth.gov/ghgcenter) data usage notebooks. Each dataset available in the [GHG Center Data Catalog](https://earth.gov/ghgcenter/data-catalog) has an associated “Introductory notebook” created by the GHG Center team which demonstrates how to access, visualize, and conduct basic data analysis in a Jupyter Notebook environment. Additional notebooks may be provided with each dataset. Click on a dataset under “GHG Center Dataset Tutorials” to learn more about the dataset and to view the associated code notebooks.

Along with GHG Center-curated notebooks, science users can also contribute notebooks that use GHG Center datasets. Notebooks submitted by the scientific community can be found under the “Community-Contributed Tutorials” section. 

## GHG Center Dataset Tutorials
Tutorial notebooks created by the GHG Center team. Introductory notebooks demonstrate how to access, visualize, and conduct basic data analysis for each dataset available in the [GHG Center Data Catalog](https://earth.gov/ghgcenter/data-catalog). Notebooks demonstrating how to conduct additional or more specialized analyses may also be listed under the relevant dataset.

## Community-Contributed Tutorials
Notebooks provided by the scientific community that use GHG Center datasets. The GHG Center is in the process of establishing a workflow for community notebook contribution. Once available, the contribution process will be published here. In the meantime, please submit any notebook contribution inquiries through the [US GHG Center Contact Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeVWCrnca08Gt_qoWYjTo6gnj1BEGL4NCUC9VEiQnXA02gzVQ/viewform).    
**Note**: these notebooks are contributed by the scientific community, and are not maintained by the GHG Center team.
